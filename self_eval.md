# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
 - *Pretty confident! I don't feel like I know many methods, but I feel confident about the syntax and purpose of methods.*
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
 - *Confident! Same as above - I know that there is a huge amount I don't know, but I feel confident in the syntax and how to name arguments and use them in simple methods.*
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
 - *How do you write a method that takes a flexible number of arguments? Like if you wanted to write a method that takes all arguments and adds them together, but you don't want to specify that it will take two, or three, or four, etc arguments - how do you leave that open ended?*
